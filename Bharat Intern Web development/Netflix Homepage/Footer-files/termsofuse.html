                        <br><br>1.1. Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the
                        Netflix service you must have Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and
                        provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means
                        a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to
                        time,
                        and which may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless
                        you
                        cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize
                        us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment

                        including subscriptions offered by third parties
                        in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not

                        subscription plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which
                        will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to
                        you.

                        determined

                        eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership
                        may
                        not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use information

                        existing or recent Netflix membership to determine Offer eligibility. The

                        <br><br>3.1. <span class="underline">Billing Cycle.</span> The subscription fee
                        for
                        the Netflix service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your
                        use
                        of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,
                        will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on
                        the
                        "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of
                        subscription plan that you choose when you signed up for
                        the service. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your
                        Payment
                        Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or
                        if
                        your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a given
                        month. Visit the netflix.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on
                        the
                        "Account" page to see your next payment date. We may authorize your Payment
                        Method
                        in anticipation of subscription or service-related
                        charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to
                        approximately
                        one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using
                        your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find
                        the billing information about your Netflix subscription by visiting your account
                        with the applicable third party.
                        <br><br>3.2. <span class="underline">Payment Methods.</span> To use the Netflix
                        service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge
                        any
                        Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary
                        Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your
                        subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a
                        payment
                        is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds,
                        or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to
                        the
                        service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some
                        Payment
                        Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign
                        transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment
                        Method.
                        Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your
                        Payment Method service provider for details.<br><br>3.3.
                        <span class="underline">Updating your Payment Methods.</span> You can update
                        your
                        Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment
                        Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following
                        any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment
                        Method(s).<br><br>3.4. <span class="underline">Cancellation.</span> You can
                        cancel
                        your Netflix membership at any time, and you will continue to have
                        access to the Netflix service through the end of your billing period. To the
                        extent
                        permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not
                        provide
                        refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or
                        unused Netflix content. To cancel, go to the "Account" page and follow the
                        instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will
                        automatically close at the end of your current billing period.
                        To see when your account will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account"
                        page.
                        If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment
                        Method and wish to cancel your Netflix
                        membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by
                        visiting
                        your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or
                        unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party.
                        <br><br>3.5. <span class="underline">Changes to the Price and Subscription
                            Plans.</span> We may change our subscription plans and the price of our
                        service
                        from time to time. We will notify you at least one month before any

                        <br><br>4.1. You must be at least 18 years of age&nbsp; to become a member of
                        the
                        Netflix service. Minors may only use the service under the supervision of an
                        adult.
                        <br><br>4.2. The Netflix service and any content accessed through the service
                        are
                        for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with
                        individuals
                        beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your subscription
                        plan. During your Netflix membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
                        non-transferable right to access the Netflix service and Netflix content. Except
                        for
                        the foregoing, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to
                        you. You agree not to use the service for public performances.<br><br>4.3. You
                        may
                        access the Netflix content primarily within the country in which you have
                        established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer
                        our service and have licensed such content. For the purpose of determining the
                        taxes
                        that will be charged over your subscription fee, we will use the IP address that
                        is
                        used when you sign up to the Netflix service. The content
                        that may be available will vary by geographic location and will change from time
                        to
                        time. The number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on
                        your
                        chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Account"
                        page.<br><br>4.4. The Netflix service, including the content library, is
                        regularly
                        updated and we may give you the opportunity to watch live or special events
                        (including replays of such content) or to enjoy new additional features.
                        Such content and new features may contain commercial breaks and other types of
                        commercial messages. Netflix does not endorse or sponsor any advertised products

                        websites, user interfaces and promotional features. You can turn off test
                        participation at any time by visiting the "Account" page and changing the "Test

                        viewing on certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply,

                        quality of the display of the Netflix content may vary from device
                        to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your location,
                        the
                        bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra
                        HD
                        and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and
                        device capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as HD,
                        Ultra
                        HD or HDR and not all subscription plans allow you to receive content in all
                        formats. The minimum connection speed for HD video quality (defined
                        as a resolution of 720p or higher) is 3.0 Mbps per stream; however, we recommend
                        a
                        faster connection for improved video quality. A connection speed of at least 5.0
                        Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Full HD video quality
                        (defined as a resolution of 1080p or higher). A connection speed of at least
                        15.0
                        Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD video quality (defined as a
                        resolution of 4K or higher). You are responsible for all Internet
                        access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for information on
                        possible
                        Internet data usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching Netflix content
                        will vary based on a number of factors, including your location,
                        available bandwidth at the time, the content you have selected and the
                        configuration
                        of your Netflix ready device.
