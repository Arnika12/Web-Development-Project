        or race) to you. We have a Help article that explains how our content recommendations system works -
        spoilers:
        the biggest driver of these recommendations is what you actually choose to watch through our service. You

                <h3>Business transfers:</h3> In connection with any reorganization, restructuring, merger or sale,
                or other transfer of assets, we will transfer information, including personal information, provided that
                the receiving
                party agrees to respect your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy
                Statement.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Whenever in the course of sharing information we transfer personal information to other countries we will
        ensure that the information is transferred in accordance with this Privacy Statement and as permitted by the
        applicable laws on data protection. You can find out more about how we disclose and transfer your personal
        information
        internationally at this link: <span><a href="Footer-files/internationalhelp.html">help.netflix.com/legal/personal-information-international-transfers.</a></span>

        <p style="padding: 20px;">You may also choose to disclose your information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul type="disc"></ul>
        <li>certain portions of our service may contain a tool which gives you the option to share information by email,
            text message and social or other sharing applications, using the clients and applications on your smart
            device;</li>
        <li>social plugins and similar technologies allow you to share information; and</li>
        <li>through Netflix game features, such as multiplayer options and leaderboards.</li>
        <p>Social plugins and social applications are operated by the social networks themselves, and are subject to
            their terms of use and privacy policies. Similarly, some of the Netflix game features mentioned above (such
            as
            multiplayer gameplay, leaderboards, and game saving options) may require use of a third-party service, which
            is subject to that service’s terms of use and privacy policy.</p>

        <h2>Access to Account and Profiles</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>
                <h3>“Remember me” function:</h3> For ease of access to your account, you can use the "Remember me on
                this device"  function when you log in to the website. This function uses technology that enables us to provide direct
                account access and to help administer the Netflix service without requiring reentry of any password or
                other user identification when your browser revisits the service.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Giving others access to your account:</h3> If you share or otherwise allow others to have access to
                your account,  they will be able to see shows you have watched, ratings, account information (including your email
                address  or other information in the "Account" area of our website), and game related information (such as your
                in-game name and saved game progress). This remains true even if you use our profiles feature. You might have
                the option to use seamless account login through the Netflix mobile app, which enables login to the Netflix app on
                smart TVs, set top boxes, and other streaming media devices on the network to which you are connected. If you
                use that feature, those devices will remain signed into your account unless you later log out of those devices.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Profiles:</h3> Profiles allow users to have a distinct, personalized Netflix experience, built
                around the movies and shows of interest to them, as well as separate watch histories. Please note that profiles are
                available to everyone who uses your Netflix account, so that anyone with access to your Netflix account can navigate
                to and use, edit or delete profiles. You should explain this to others with access to your account, and if
                you do not wish them to use or change your profile, be sure to let them know. Profile users may be offered the
                opportunity to add an email address, phone number or other information to the profile and will be
                provided with notice of collection and use at the time such information is requested (the Profile Privacy Notice applies
                (<span><a href="Footer-files/profileprivacynotice.html">help.netflix.com/legal/profileprivacy</a></span>)). We have various parental controls available, you can learn
                more by
                reading our Help article located at <span><a href="Footer-files/netflixparentalcontrol.html">help.netflix.com/node/264.</a></span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Profile Transfers:</h3> The profile transfer feature on your account allows you and users with
                access to your account to transfer an eligible profile from your account to a separate account (including information
                such as viewing history and recommendations). You can change the setting for this feature in the Settings
                section of your Account page. You can learn more by reading our Help article located at <span><a href="Footer-files/profiletransfers.html">help.netflix.com/node/122698.</a></span>
            <li>
                <h3>Removing device access to your Netflix account:</h3> To remove access to your Netflix account from
                your devices, visit the "Account" section of our website, choose "Sign out of all devices," and follow the
                instructions to deactivate your devices (note, deactivation may not occur immediately). Where possible, users of public
                or
                shared devices should log out at the completion of each visit. If you sell or return a computer or
                Netflix
                ready device, you should log out and deactivate the device before doing so. If you do not maintain the
                security of
                your password or device, or fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may be able to
                access your account, including your personal information.

        </ul>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;"><b>Email and Text Messages.</b> If you no longer want to receive certain
            communications from us via email or
            text
            message, simply access the "Communications Settings" option in the "Account" section of our website and
            uncheck those items to unsubscribe. Alternatively, click the "unsubscribe" link in the email or reply STOP
            (or as
            otherwise instructed) to the text message. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related
            correspondence from us, such as messages relating to your account transactions.</p>

        <p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0;"> <b>Push Notifications.</b> You can choose to receive mobile push notifications
            from Netflix. On some device
            operating systems, you will be automatically enrolled in the notifications. If you subsequently decide you
            no longer
            wish to receive these notifications, you can use your mobile device's settings functionality to turn them
            off. We
            also offer push notifications on certain web browsers. If you agree to receive those notifications and
            subsequently decide you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you can use your browser’s settings
            to turn them off.</p>

        <p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0;"><b>Matched Identifier Communications from Netflix.</b> Some third party sites and
            apps allow us to reach our
            users with online promotions about our titles and services by sending a privacy protective identifier to the
            third
            party. A privacy protective identifier means we convert the original information (such as an email address
            or phone number) into a value to keep the original information from being revealed. The third party compares
            the
            privacy protective identifier to identifiers in its database and there will be a match only if you have used
            same identifier (such as an email address) with Netflix and the third party. If there is a match, Netflix
            can then choose whether or not to send a given promotional communication to you on that third party site or
            app,
            and can optimize and better measure the effectiveness of online advertising. You can opt out in the
            “Marketing
            Communications” section of the “Account” section of our website. </p>

        <p style="margin: 15px 0 0 0;"> <b>Behavioral Advertising.</b> Behavioral advertisements are those that are
            selected based on your use
            and/or interactions with various unaffiliated third party apps or websites across the Internet (behavioral
            advertising). Netflix can advertise its services using behavioral advertising, and if you are using a
            browser,then certain cookies and web beacons can be used to collect information to help determine your
            likely
            interests.If you are using a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device that includes a resettable
            device
            identifier, then that identifier can be used to help determine your likely interests. For your choices about
            behavioral ads from Netflix, please see the "Cookies and Internet Advertising" section (below).
        </p>


        <h2>Cookies and Internet Advertising</h2>
        <p>We and our Service Providers use cookies and other technologies (such as web beacons), as well as resettable
            device identifiers, for various reasons. We want you to be informed about our use of these technologies, so
            this section explains the types of technologies we use, what they do, and your choices regarding their use.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies and similar technologies, web beacons, and resettable device identifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and
            online services. We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and
            WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on your device. Web beacons
            (also
            knownas clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies
            will
            impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use the Netflix app on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a
            resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers (also known as advertising
            identifiers)
            are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for
            Advertisers" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain
            streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising
            more relevant and for analytics and optimization purposes.
        </p>
        <h3> Why does Netflix use these technologies?</h3>
        <p>
            We use these types of technologies for various reasons, like making it easy to access our services by
            remembering you when you return; to provide, analyze, understand and enhance the use of our services; to
            enforce our terms, prevent fraud; to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our
            site; and
            to deliver and tailor our marketing or advertising, and to understand interactions with our emails,
            marketing,
            and online ads on third party sites.</p>

        <p>To help you better understand how we use cookies and resettable device identifiers, please see the
            information below:</p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>Essential cookies:</b> These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.
                For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members
                when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them. They also help us to
                enforce our
                Terms of Use, prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.
            </li>
            <li><b>Performance and functionality cookies:</b> These cookies help us to customize and enhance your online
                experience
                with Netflix. For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to
                re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up). We also use these
                cookies to collect
                information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other
                information)
                about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and
                service and conduct market research. Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited
                functionality of our
                service.</li>
            <li><b> Advertising cookies and resettable device identifiers:</b> These cookies and resettable device
                identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and
                emails, and to
                deliver ads that are more relevant to you and for analytics and optimization purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When we advertise our services on other websites or apps, some of the websites and apps where we advertise,
            as well as advertising technology companies that we use to purchase, deliver, optimize, and/or measure our
            advertisements (collectively “Advertising Partners”), may receive information from us as part of our
            campaign targeting, measurement, and optimization (e.g., steps completed in sign-up and site visit or app
            open/install information). Common uses of this type of information are to judge the effectiveness of and
            optimize ad campaigns, by allowing Advertising Partners to see when someone who saw an ad later signed up
            for our
            service. Another common use is to make sure we do not serve ads trying to get individuals to sign up for the
            Netflix service if they are already a Netflix user. Netflix uses contractual and technical measures designed
            to
            prevent Advertising Partners from accessing information regarding specific title selections you make, URLs
            you land on, or shows you have watched on our service. We do not share information about title selections or
            your
            shows you have watched on our service.
        </p>

        <h2>How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?</h2>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li><b>To exercise choice regarding cookies</b>
                For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking
                (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and
                across third party
                websites or online services for online behavioral advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them,
                <span><a href="#">click here</a></span>. At this time, we do not respond to web browser "do not track" signals.</li>

            <li><b>To exercise choice regarding resettable device identifiers</b> To opt out of behavioral ads from
                Netflix in connection with a resettable device identifier on a mobile
                device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device
                (usually found
                under "privacy" or "ads" in your device's settings). You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but
                they will
                not be selected based on your likely interests.</li>

            <li><b>To exercise choice regarding other technologies</b>
                There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding technologies that are similar to cookies, such
                as
                browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). For example, many popular browsers
                provide
                the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area; see your browser's
                help
                function or support area to learn more. Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared
                from within
                the application.</li>

            business purposes, such as operating, maintaining and improving our services; complying with our legal
            obligations; and exercising our legal rights and remedies, including enforcing our terms of use. Our retention of
            information is based on many factors such as your relationship with Netflix (for example, are you a Netflix current
            member); the nature of the information; compliance with our legal obligations; defending or resolving actual
            or anticipated legal claims. We take reasonable measures to destroy or de-identify personal information in a

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We use reasonable administrative, logical, physical and managerial measures to safeguard your personal
            information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, use and modification. These measures are designed
            to provide a level of security appropriate to the risks of processing your personal information.</p>

        <h2>Other Websites, Platforms and Applications</h2>
        <p>The Netflix service may be provided through and/or utilize features (such as the display of social media
            content, or the provision of voice controls) operated by third party platforms, or contain links to sites
            operated by third parties whose policies regarding the handling of information may differ from ours. For
            example, you may be able to access the Netflix service through platforms such as gaming systems, smart TVs,
            mobile devices, set top boxes and a number of other Internet connected devices. These websites and platforms
            have separate and independent privacy or data policies, privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which
            we recommend you read carefully. In addition, you may encounter third party applications that interact with
